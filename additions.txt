Things I would have added:
  more checks (such as input check, right now it is assumed to be a string, but user could break it by inputting integer instead)
  support for many-dimensional grid 
  better implementation of the obsticles (current one is rather confusing, a better one would rely on using a matrix rather than X Y Direction as fields. Which was the initial approach, but it would become more confusing to work with in a short time period.)
  better testsuite (current one relies on assertions, could have added rules for some tests)
  better implementation of the direction/boundary checking (currently some code is duplicated)
  more functional style approach in general (makes code a lot more readable, but somewhat slower)
